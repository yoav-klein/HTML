# Chapter 4 - List Types
---

Adding an ordered list: `<ol>` with list items: `<li>`
And an unordered list: `<ul>`
And also a description list: `<dt>`

Notice that in the unordered list part, we still have big spaces between lines - this is because
we kept the `<p>` tags, whereas in the oredered list there are small spaces.
