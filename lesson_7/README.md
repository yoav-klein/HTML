# Chapter 7 - Semantic Tags
---

Introduced:
1. `<header>` - you can have more than one header in your page. We've wrapped our `<h1>` and the `<nav>` elements in a header, to say
that this is the header of the page.
2. `<main>` - You can only have one main element in your page.
3. `<footer>` - Like header, can be multiple.
4. `aria-label` attribute in the `<nav>` element.
5. `<article>` instead of `<section>`
6. `<aside>` is a semantic element. It is the less important thing in the section.
7. `<details>` and `<summary>` work together.
